# Analysing Petrol Prices in the UK Over Time Using Prophet

This project explores Petrol price dynamics using time series analysis
techniques. The data used for this analysis is downloaded from [UK's
Government Data
Page](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices)
and I will be using the price of Unleaded Petrol for my analysis. I,
then extracted data for Petrol in another file and saved it as a csv
file. The petrol prices in this data is based on the average UK pump
prices from six companies and recorded weekly. This data starts from
June 2003. The prices in the data set is in terms of pence. (Â£1=100p)

## Objective of this project

By analysing this dataset, the main objective of this project is to seek
to understand the patterns and trends of Petrol prices in the UK over
time, and ultimately to forecast the price of Petrol in the UK next
year. I will be using Meta's Prophet library to model the data.

## 1.Setting up the Data

In this chapter, we will deal with setting up the library, loading the
data into R, and for defining our dataframe.

### 1.1 Set up the library

I would like to first load the prophet in my library. To load it a
simple R-code has been written down:

```{r}
library(prophet)
```

Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Meta, which is designed to
simplify time series forecasting tasks. This will help us in analysing
the components of the price of Petrol over time and also forecast the
future prices .

### 1.2 Loading the data into the R

Now, we try to load the data in the system.

```{r}
fuel_data<-read.csv("C:/Users/pkeni/OneDrive - Queen Mary, University of London/Petrol Price UK .csv")
```

Now that I have loaded the data into R my next step would be converting
it into dataframe of prices and volumes. I am making sure that the data
reads through so I have converted them into Date and numeric form so
that prophet is able to fit it. Initially, I will also look at weekly
seasonality of the data as I want to identify recurring patterns to
exhibit distinct petrol price movements. Also, as the prices are
recorded on a weekly basis, I believe weekly seasonality would work the
best in this terms.

```{r}
fuel_data$date<-as.Date(fuel_data$Date)
fuel_data$Price<-as.numeric(fuel_data$Price)
petrol_price <-data.frame(
  ds=zoo::as.Date(fuel_data$Date),
  y=fuel_data$Price)

```

## 2. Historic Data Analysis

In this chapter, we look at the historic data and analyse it.

### 2.1 Visualising the Petrol Price Data

In this section, I will simply just plot the petrol price solely based
in its historic price.

```{r}
plot(petrol_price$ds,petrol_price$y, main="Petrol Prices over year from 2003 to 2024", xlab="Year",ylab="Petrol Prices (p per litre) ",type="l")
```

The historical data suggests that the petrol prices show a rising trend
throughout the years with significant volatility. It shows a notably
sharp rise and fall of prices between 2020 and 2025, which shows
significant volatility in recent years.

### 2.2 Decomposing the Time Series Data

Now to further examine the time series, we tend to decompose the data.
As the data was loaded manually in R, I had some problem in decomposing
it to look at the trend, seasonality, cyclic patterns and residual noise
in the data. So, to decompose the data, I first convert it into a Time
Series Using function **ts()**. As I know that the original data starts
from 09 June 2003, I start the data from the very date and as it is
weekly I set the frequency of the Time Series to be 52.

```{r}
fuel_data_ts<-ts(fuel_data$Price,start=c(2003,06,09),frequency=52)
```

As the time series "fuel_data_ts" has been defined, now I decompose the
time series to see how it performs.

```{r}
plot(decompose(fuel_data_ts))
```

We can see that the additive model has been fitted in the Time Series.
We can depict that the fuel price has an overall of increasing trend
across the time frame.It is also noticeable that the trend is more
volatile after 2017. We can also see that the noise has increased over
the recent years from 2022. This indicates unpredictable shocks in
recent years, which can also be explained because of the energy crisis
in the UK. Overall, especially in the first few years, the data doesn't
look very noisy. The seasonality suggests that the changes in fuel
prices have been repeated clearly and consistently at regular interval
over time. The peak suggests that the petrol price increases at certain
times of year, which might be linked to seasonal demand changes.

*Note: I have only used the fuel_data_ts here as it is transformed into
Time Series data type in R, in the other sections, i will be using the
petrol_price data frame which I particularly defined for prophet, as it
has the recorded date from the dataset for consistency and accuracy.*

### 2.3 Fitting Linear Trend Function to the Time Series

I, now, will run a linear regression which will help me gain
understanding of the growth of the petrol prices in the UK. Here, I will
use the **lm** function.

```{r}
plot(petrol_price$ds,petrol_price$y, type='l', xlab='Year', ylab='Price of Petrol', main='')
Linearmodel_fuel=lm(petrol_price$y~petrol_price$ds,petrol_price)
lines(petrol_price$ds,fitted(Linearmodel_fuel), type="l", col='red')
```

The trend line suggests an upward trend in the fuel price data. It also
suggests volatile fluctuations in the prices which peaks around
2020-2022.

```{r}
summary(Linearmodel_fuel)
```

It is evident that the Residual Standard Error is 14.02, which means
that the model is in average 14.02 pence off while using this to predict
the fuel price. The multiple R squared value of 60.16% suggests that the
60.16% of variability in the petrol prices can be explained by the time
in this model.

## 3. Using Prophet to Model the Petrol Prices

In this chapter, I use prophet to fit the petrol prices, and forecast
the future petrol prices in the UK.

### 3.1 Fitting the Data into Prophet Model

Now, I will fit the data frame (petrol.prices) into prophet to analyse
the data. This prophet function is used to fit the model. I won't use
daily and weekly seasonality as this data has been recorded weekly, as
it won't have clear predictions for each day of the week.

```{r}
model_price=prophet::prophet(petrol_price,weekly.seasonality = FALSE)
```

The prophet model is an additive model with components such as trend,
seasonality, holidays and error terms.

### 3.2 Future Price Data Frame Setup

Now that the model has been fitted using the prophet function, the
predictions are made on the dataframe, using the funtion
**make_future_dataframe**, this function takes the model object and a
number of periods to forecast to provide a suitable dataframe of the
dates.

```{r}
future_price<-make_future_dataframe(model_price,periods=52,freq="week")
tail(future_price)
```

As, this project is based on a weekly dataset, the future predictions
are based will also be on weekly forecast for better accuracy, so I have
set the frequency to week. Here, the data frame is set such that it is
ready to forecast fuel prices weekly up-to a year.

### 3.3 Forecasting the Future Prices

As the new data frame has been defined in chapter 3.2, here I will use
the dataframe defined to make future predictions of petrol prices. For
this I will use the function **predict**. This function is responsible
to make predictions from the results of different model fitting
functions.

```{r}
predict_futureprice=predict(model_price,future_price)
tail(predict_futureprice[c('ds','yhat','yhat_lower','yhat_upper')])
```

The table above contains the predictions of the future petrol prices
weekly ranging from February 5,2025 to March 10, 2025, which is exactly
like a year far from now. It has the price predictions with their
associated confidence intervals, where **yhat_lower** represents the
lower bound of the confidence interval whereas **yhat_upper** represents
the upper bound, and **yhat** represents the forecasted price of petrol.
The predictions during this specific time (form Feb 2025 to March) seem
to vary between 164.84p/litre to 167.31p/litre, and it is also
noticeable that the price has an increasing trend with time constraint.

### 3.4 Visualising the Forecast

Now, the forecast made in section 3.3 can be visualised using Dygraphs,
which is an interactive plot of the future predictions.

```{r}
library(dygraphs)
dyplot.prophet(model_price,predict_futureprice)
```

In the graph above, the X-axis denotes time in years, whereas the Y-
axis denotes the petrol prices per litre in pence. It is evident that
Prophet has been able to explain the variability in the data most of the
time, as the actual data points mostly fall within the confidence
interval bounds of predicted petrol prices. But, in some instances such
as in extreme values, the model wasn't able to explain the variations.
These extreme values are generally cause by external factors, for
instance, the petrol prices in 2022 was heavily impacted because of the
Russia Ukraine war - which caused major energy crisis in the United
Kingdom, leading to the rapid acceleration in the price of petrol. The
model also predicts that the prices of petrol will not reach towards its
all time maximum in 2022 in the upcoming year.

### 3.5 Further Examinations

To further examine the petrol price, I will use the function
**prophet_plot_components**, which is responsible to plot the components
of prophet forecast which include: trend, holidays, weekly seasonality
and yearly seasonality and others. We will use this function to see the
forecasted petrol prices into trend, weekly seasonality and yearly
seasonality.

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(model_price,predict_futureprice)
```

The trend forecasted by the Prophet forecasting tool shows that the
petrol prices grow at a linear rate from 2020 to 2025. It also suggests
that the rate of growth from 2020 to 2025 is higher than the growth rate
from 2015 to 2020. The data overall has a linear growth except for the
time period from 2010 to 2016, the trend here more looks quadratic with
a local maxima of 125p in between 2012 and 2013.

The yearly seasonality data suggests that the prices are usually higher
usually from May to November. This suggests that the fuel prices
typically increase during summer, which is logical, as people more often
travel during this time, especially with holidays and road trips during
these months, which tend to increase the demand of petrol, which results
in increasing price of petrol.

## 4. Conclusion

This project has utilised Prophet to analyse and forecast the Petrol
Prices in the UK, which revealed a general upward trend through years.
The forecast indicates a continued rise in petrol prices over the next
year. It also shows the particular higher prices in fuel throughout the
summer as anticipated.

Even though, the model captures the overall trends and seasonality,
incorporating other economic and external factors would definitely
enhance the accuracy. This analysis will generally help assists the
stakeholders in planning and decision-making with the fluctuating fuel
costs.
